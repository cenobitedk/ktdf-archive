	<h1><a href="../../../2018/02/01/announcement-23-first-european-show-ever-of-fetid-us/index.html">Announcement # 23: first european show ever of FETID (us)!!</a></h1>
		<p>Yet again a return to the promised focus on the current US underground scene and this time we travel to the infamous city of Seattle, Washington, who in recent years have regurgitated many young promising death metal acts and this is amongst our favorites of recent years; we are excited to present to you for the first time ever in Europe, the reeking fresh corpse of <strong>FETID!</strong></p>
<p>Fetid came to being in 2016 with the name change from the dissolved cadaver of Of Corpse, a band two thirds of the members played in from 2013 leading up to the formation of Fetid. In a lot of ways Of Corpse was the beginning of what we hear in Fetid today. Where Of Corpse were heavier (or should we say faster) on the grind side of extreme metal, Fetid delves deeper into absolute gut-wrenching and bowel-extracting death metal heaviness. The duo was joined by Chelsea on bass, who also plays in Seattle death grind band Cauterized, after the name change and started playing local shows and arranged to record a demo.</p>
<p>In 2017 the band released their debut demo suitably entitled <em>“Sentient Pile of Amorphous Rot”</em>, though Headsplit Records and later in the year Extremely Rotten Productions, a showcase of the bands undeniably disgusting and brutally heavy grinding death metal with ultra low tuning and vile deep growls. Rumor has it that Fetid are scheduled to record and release an LP for US Northwest extreme music label 20 Buck Spin this year.</p>
<p>The <em>“Sentient Pile of Amorphous Rot”</em> demo was received extremely well across both the US and Europe and we behind KTDF are repulsively excited about presenting them for the first time in The Old World in September 2018, when Fetid spills their grotesque audio infection in Pumpehuset!</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/31/announcement-21-dead-void-uk-dk/index.html">Announcement #22: DEAD VOID (uk/dk)!</a></h1>
		<p>We have taken on a few demo bands over the years because we see their potential –the same goes with the band we are about to announce tonight. Consisting of three expatriates living in Copenhagen – all with backgrounds in various prominent bands &#8211; this new project have already played 2 shows abroad, but still no shows in Copenhagen. We wanna keep the level up for them, so we have invited them to play our new outdoor stage in “Byhaven” to warm you guys up straight from the afternoon on our &#8220;Gloomy Sunday&#8221;! We are excited to present to you <strong>DEAD VOID!!</strong></p>
<p>Former members of Grave Miasma, Conan and Virus met in the pubs of Copenhagen and fell together to create a Non-Ritualistic Death Metal power trio. They played their first gig in Bucharest in April 2017 with Czech legends Root, and second live appearance at The Abyss Underground Festival in Gothenburg alongside bands like Nifelheim, Ram, Necromantheon and many others. They released their first official demo <em>&#8216;The Looming Spectre&#8217; with </em>4 songs in January 2018, which was immediately sold out due to high demand. More are being made as we speak.</p>
<p>Think Cianide playing Candlemass riffs in Goatlord&#8217;s rehearsal basement. No rituals. No trends. Just dark, twisted and fucking heavy Death Metal.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/30/announcement-21-cadaveric-incubator-fin/index.html">Announcement #21: CADAVERIC INCUBATOR (fin)!</a></h1>
		<p>We return to present more corpses for the mass grave that will be KTDF 2018. This time we are bringing down more depravity from the northern part of Scandinavia in the form of some Finnish exhumers who happened to have released one of the most vile and disgusting death grind releases of 2017. Therefor we’re happy to present <strong>CADAVERIC INCUBATOR</strong> on the stage of our Resurrection!</p>
<p>Cadaveric Incubator was formed in 2005 by Necroterror (bass/vocals) and Humiliator (guitar/vocals) with the help of various drummers who came and went during the bands first incarnation which lasted around two years. The aim was to create old school disgusting sounds influenced by early Carcass, Repulsion, Autopsy, Xysma, Mortician, Blood and more vile and gory grinding death metal acts of death metal’s youth. But after two demos – of which only the first one <em>“Resurgence of Morbidity</em>” was released – and countless live shows, the band split up in early 2007 due to personal problems between the members.</p>
<p>Seven years later, in 2014, Necroterror resurrected Cadaveric Incubator by teaming up with his old comrade Pentele, who he had know from the early 90’s scene – Back in the deep Finnish backwoods when Necroterror played in his first-ever death metal band, Excrement, and Pentele was drumming for Carnifex and Festerday in the same area. Original founding member Humiliator was asked to join as well and the new demo <em>“Unburied Abominations“</em> was recorded. After several brutal live shows and a demo compilation released by Terror from Hell Records, the band finally recorded 12 tracks in early 2016 for their debut album, <em>“Sermons of the Devouring Dead</em>”, that was released by Hell’s Headbangers Records in 2017. The band has played in Finland and Russia, but this will be the first time they venture a bit down south of Finland.</p>
<p>Embrace the endoparasites of the Cadaveric Incubator and feel the <em>“Gravestench Asphyxiation”</em>:<br />

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/29/announcement-20-antiversum-ch/index.html">Announcement #20: ANTIVERSUM (ch)!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we are presenting the only Swiss band that KTDF will be hosting this year. With just one demo behind them and a fresh full-length out on Invictus Productions, this Swiss 5 piece plays a hybrid version of death metal &#8211; incorporating elements of doom and black metal in the veins of fellow Zürich bands like Bölzer and Deathcult, but still with their own unique style and blend. We are excited to present to you the anti-cosmic entity known as <strong>ANTIVERSUM!</strong><br />
<strong><br />
</strong>Formed in 2010 by dedicated and experienced musicians in the Swiss metal scene, Antiversum is an utterly nihilistic entity, which creates a disturbing, oppressing and storming amalgamation of black, doom, and death metal, manifesting the end of the universe, the dawn of nothingness and the collapse of existence itself in audial waves. Completely detached from every concept of spirituality, religion and other humanistic views, Antiversum began its journey into the void in the spring of 2015, when Invictus Productions released the band&#8217;s debut demo, “<em>Total Vacuum”</em>, to international acclaim. After an appearance on a 6-way Split, alongside other Swiss Extreme Metal names such as i.e. Deathcult and Bölzer, Antiversum would further stretch spaces in between the Void with their idiosyncratic vortex of violence, in their first debut Album, “<em>Cosmos Comedenti”,</em> released in 2017 again by Invictus Productions.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/28/announcement-19-scolex-us/index.html">Announcement #19: SCOLEX (us)!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we turn our focus towards the States one more time for another band that has been around in various constellations but still never made it over to this side of the pond. After a small hiatus the band we are about to announce is back with a stronger line-up than ever and ready to conquer Europe with a one-off exclusive show at KTDF!!! We are very stoked to present to you the first and for now only Euro appearance of <strong>SCOLEX!!!<br />
</strong><br />
Formed in Oakland, CA in 2010 by drummer/vocalist Justin Green and bassist/vocalist Erika Osterhout. Handling guitar duties themselves (with guest appearances from Danny Corralles of AUTOPSY, the duo recorded four tracks of doomy, punk-influenced death metal in late 2011, and released <em>&#8220;Torn From Beyond&#8221;</em> as a 12&#8243; mini-LP on Osterhout&#8217;s own label Lunar Tomb Records. With a live lineup in place they did several mini-tours in 2012 and 2013 with bands like Necrot and Undergang. In July 2013 they opened for Autopsy&#8217;s first and only show ever in Seattle, WA, which lead to Eric Cutler replacing both guitarists in 2014 for a few shows including one with Undergang and Trepanation. Shortly afterwards the band went on hiatus but the members kept busy with other projects like Femacoffin, Extraction and Necrosic. In 2018 Scolex returned with a new lineup of guitarists Sonny Reinhardt (Necrot, Saviours) and Paul Riedl (Spectral Voice, Blood Incantation) for another West Coast tour with Acephalix, Mortiferum and Fetid, sharing the stage with Mortuous, Hell, Skeletal Remains and more. With an exclusive European appearance at Kill-Town Death Fest this September and an impending split 7&#8243; with Mortuous on Carbonized Records, Scolex is back and heavier than ever.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/27/announcement-18-galvanizer-fin/index.html">Announcement #18: GALVANIZER (fin)!</a></h1>
		<p>Once again Finland proves to have a healthy young death metal presence and only a few years ago Galvanizer was shat into existence and has impressed deadheads worldwide in the wake of their short career so far. Therefore KTDF is disgustingly delighted to present <strong>GALVANIZER</strong> on stage of our 2018 edition!</p>
<p>Formed in 2013 as a one-man project, it grew to 2 members in August 2014 and they recorded their debut demo <em>“Ground Above”</em> later that year. The demo offered their first take on brutal, grinding death metal with lots of energy, grittiness and overall crudity to the recording production and song writing. 2015 saw their first release with a new drummer and therefore a solid line-up for the band and they recorded and released the EP <em>“Horrid Tales of Death”</em> which showed improvement in song writing, production and deliverance and followed the release with playing shows several places in Finland and Denmark in 2016. They have now recorded their debut album <em>“Sanguine Vigil”</em> to be released in early 2018 and will be promoting that during the Resurrection of Kill-Town this September.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/26/announcement-17-necrowretch-fr-returns-to-ktdf/index.html">Announcement #17 : NECROWRETCH (fr) returns to KTDF!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we have reached the halfway mark of the annoucements &#8211; 17 announced – 18 to go. We have also sold 2/3rds of the tickets meaning that there is only 200 tickets left for sale…</p>
<p>The band we are about to announce contacted us when we had just started organizing the first edition of the fest back in early 2010. Back then just a demo band, but we could hear the potential in their music and the burning passion behind this project so we decided to give them a shot. Now 8 years later, 3 full-lengths, 3 EP´s and 2 compilations down the road <strong>NECROWRETCH</strong> has come a long way and developed into one of the main contemporary French death metal bands and we are proud to have them back at KTDF VI!<br />
<u><br />
</u>Necrowretch was started in Valence, Rhône-Alpes in 2018 by guitarist Vlad with <em>&#8220;the impure intention to play sadistic-gravecracking-possessed death metal&#8221;</em>. After recording demos through Skeleton Plague Records, Aural Offerings Records, and releasing 2 EP&#8217;s through Detest Records, Necrowretch signed to Century Media Records in 2012, releasing 2 full length albums before signing to Seasons of Mist who released their latest album <em>“Satanic Slavery”</em> in 2017.</p>
<p>Inspired by Swedish extremists like Merciless, Nihilist or Marduk over to Finnish legends Impaled Nazarene or early US brutality like Death, it is Vlad’s rabid screams, the fast played, occasionally even melodic black metallic riffing that defines their trademark vicious and maniacal sound. While Necrowretch’s roots reach deep into the underground scene, a German debut show with Asphyx, a mini-tour with Morbus Chron, notable festival appearances at Kill-Town Death Fest 2010, the Fenriz curated Live Evil fest 2013, PartySan 2014, Necrowretch has gathered many new followers over the past years, no matter if they come from a death, black or thrash background. Developing constantly further, while remaining true to their original harsh and primitive sound, the trio is eager to expand its live activities and will hit the roads of Europe in September with Cemetery Urn from Australia.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/25/annoncement-16-cemetery-urn-aus/index.html">Annoncement #16: CEMETERY URN (aus)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we have the pleasure of presenting one of Australia’s most obscene death metal bands to Europe for the first time ever. With a 12 year long history behind them its finally time to unleash their wrath upon Europe. We are proud to present the first European performance ever of <strong>CEMETERY URN</strong> at KTDF 2018!!!</p>
<p>Formed in 2006 in Melbourne Australia, Cemetery Urn specializes in a vicious bestial form of Death Metal they’ve branded ‘Australian barbaric death metal’.  The band itself is deeply rooted and has a long history in Australian extreme metal with current members involved in bands such as Abominator, Ignivomous, Bestial Warlust, Belligerent Intent, to name a few. Currently signed to Hell’s Headbangers Records, the band has released 3 full-length albums to date – the latest one in 2017, a ten track nuclear warhead titled <em>‘Cemetery Urn’</em> and will be releasing a new full-length album in mid-2018.  The band has played numerous tours and festival performances across Asia and North America and in September/October 2018 they will hit Europe in support of both new releases.</p>
<p>Listen to <em>“The Deepest of Graves”</em> from their latest S/T album here; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqDIwiIcP6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqDIwiIcP6I</a><br />

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/24/announcement-15-torture-rack-us/index.html">Announcement #15: TORTURE RACK (us)!</a></h1>
		<p>Another day has passed and we now offer you more of the rising grotesquery that the current US death metal scene has to offer. This time it has come to the North West mutilating barbarians <strong>TORTURE RACK</strong> who will be performing their very first European gig ever at KTDF!</p>
<p>Torture Rack was formed in 2012 in Portland, Oregon, and released their debut demo <em>“Medieval Mutilation”</em> in 2013 through Headsplit Records, a debut release showcasing sheer brutality and violence over 4 songs full of crude memorable riffs and lots of headbang-encouraging grooves. 2015 saw the release of their debut album <em>“Barbaric Persecution”</em> offering more precise re-recordings of the killer songs from their demo and several new abominable intestine-twisting songs to their catalogue. Their death metal is soaked in the crudity and unmatched brutality found in a lot of the American East Coast bands from the early 90’ies perfectly wrapped in rough crunchy guitars, bowel liquefying bass, steam rolling drumming and gut puking low grunts all making Torture Rack the foul death metal creature it is.</p>
<p>The band has played many shows around their home in the North West and got invited over to play at the infamous Maryland Death Fest in 2017, truly delivering their caveman death metal putrescence from a bigger scale stage. Their second full length has recently been recorded and has been scheduled for a 2018 release, so it’s our dissolving pleasure to help promote that upcoming torturous death metal splatter platter by bringing them over to Europe for the first time and spew chunky gory metal at us from the stage in Pumpehuset!</p>
<p>Fear the Torture Rack, follow us and enter the<em> “Chamber of Morbidity”:</em><br />

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/23/announcement-14-taphos/index.html">Announcement #14: TAPHOS!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we are introducing you to the newest spawn of the Copenhagen death metal family. With just two demo tapes and an EP out this young outfit seems to already have a lot going for them. A full length has been recorded and will be released this spring by Blood Harvest Records, followed by a European tour with the mighty Degial. We are excited to present to you <strong>TAPHOS!</strong></p>
<p>Taphos was spawned in 2015 with the purpose to create music that evokes desperation and hopelessness. Their music is rooted in death and draws inspirations from all darker aspects of life and life thereafter.</p>
<p>The first eruption took place in form of the demo <em>MMXVI</em> and an EP, named <em>MMXVII,</em> followed soon after. Same year Taphos entered Ballade Studios where enough chaos was captured to produce what will be their first full-length. An aftershock from this séance took place in form of the <em>&#8216;Premonition&#8217;</em> tape.</p>
