	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/22/announcement-13-first-ever-european-live-performance-of-portlands-triumvir-foul/index.html">Announcement #13:  first ever European live performance of Portland´s TRIUMVIR FOUL!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we have another North American band that has never performed live in Europe to announce. This Portland based chaotic bestial two-piece death metal outfit consists of 2 members of the celebrated cult act Ash Borer who are no strangers to performing live in Europe. We are proud and excited to present to you the first ever European performance of <strong>TRIUMVIR FOUL</strong> at KTDF 2018!!!</p>
<p>Triumvir Foul began in 2014 as a two-man project, focusing on the worship of death and destruction, which was matched by their ugly and depraved death metal sound. After several line-up- changes, Triumvir Foul&#8217;s return to their original two-man line-up has allowed them to create, a more focused and raw sound, fusing the atmospheres of both their 2015 eponymous album and 2014 debut <em>An Oath of Blood and Fire </em>demo.</p>
<p>Their music is an unrelentingly dense, filthy expanse of morbid Metal of Death bestiality, base and belligerent at the core and yet plumbing depths of the psyche that otherwise betray such a seemingly simple, on-the-surface assault.</p>
<p>Triumvir Foul delves into the perverse evolution of unhinged hedonism and carnal irreverence through the exploration of carnage in the spectral realm. Expanding beyond the themes of occultism and mythological allegories of the self-titled first album, the sophomore album <em>Spiritual Bloodshed</em> takes on a much more direct approach, clenching at the throat of one&#8217;s putrid desires.</p>
<p>Listen to <em>“Spiritual Bloodshed”:</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkAUb6kzNiE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkAUb6kzNiE</a><br />

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/21/announcement-12-reptilian-no/index.html">Announcement #12: REPTILIAN (no)!</a></h1>
		<p>Since the inception of <strong>KTDF</strong> we have been following the Norwegian scene that has brought us great bands like Execration and Obliteration. The band we are about to announce is following the path laid out by these said bands and, of course, granddaddies Cadaver. Through ancient Aztec mythology to transcending death mysticism, they leave no stone unturned on their way showing that there is a new breed of Norwegian death metal on the rise. Currently on tour in Europe laying venue after venue in ruins we are excited to present to you; <strong>REPTILIAN!</strong></p>
<p>Formed in the remote corner of Fusa, Norway, Reptilian came gushing out like a stream of fresh blood onto the scene with its split 7″EP with fellow Death Thrashing warriors Inculter through Unborn Productions in 2012. After several concerts and festival appearances, they promptly established themselves as a band not to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Reptilian‘s debut album <em>Perennial Void Traverse</em> from 2016 whipped forth a whirlwind of utterly twisted, fever-dreaming death metal and was well-received by the international metal community. Reptilian draws the listener into a void of ghastly contours that continually shapeshifts. Lumbering and lurking down-tempos instil an atmosphere of dread and impending doom, all before explosions of filth-banging thrash burst forth and hammer onward, only for the momentum to be up-ended by further lurking and creeping death, and a whole host of manoeuvres that defy easy comprehension: the tools at Reptilian‘s disposal are many, and with an enviously fluid sense of mastery, they weave together a rich, red-eyed tapestry of hysteria and unease. Reptilian execute their death metal magic with a tightness and confidence that are blanching to behold; chaos may threaten to creep in, but the band fully harness its powers and make it their servant.</p>
<p>Pay witness to a new beginning and step deep inside Reptilian‘s <em>Perennial Void Traverse</em>.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/20/announcement-11-spectral-voice-us/index.html">Announcement #11: SPECTRAL VOICE (US)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we will continue with yet another announcement for the Gloomy Sunday. In our humble opinion this band released one of the best albums of 2017 and maybe one of the best doom/death / funeral doom albums of all time… We are stoked beyond the stars in the sky to announce that <strong>SPECTRAL VOICE</strong> will join us at KTDF 2018!!!</p>
<p>The Spectral Voice crawled out of the doomed abyss of Denver, Colorado (US) in late 2012 to play slow rotting death/doom from beyond the grave. Focusing on gloomy funeral atmosphere and the ancient death-metal feeling. Their early performances and rehearsal tapes were well received and word of their morbid aura quickly spread through the underground. January 2015 saw their first official release, the &#8220;<em>Necrotic Doom</em>&#8221; demo, which sold 300 copies before their first West Coast tour in March the same year. Eventually selling over 700 copies, the cassette was re-released in Europe through Iron Bonehead Productions (DE) and again on compact disc by Dark Descent Records (US). In September 2015 they released a split 7&#8243; with Blood Incantation (US), and made their first East Coast appearance at Martyrdoom Festival IV in New York City. Following the success of their demo and 7&#8243;, the band played Covenant Festival II (CAN) in June 2016 and embarked on the massive &#8220;Melting Across America&#8221; tour with Undergang (DK) during July. By the end of the year they had played California Deathfest, Metal Threat Festival (both US) and released a split 7&#8243; with Denmark&#8217;s Phrenelith, as well as vinyl repress of &#8220;<em>Necrotic Doom</em>&#8220;. In February 2017 the band recorded their debut album <em>“Eroded Corridors of Unbeing”</em>, which was released by Dark Descent Records in time for their first European tour in October 2017 with Blood Incantation. While the band&#8217;s recent splits hint at a faster, more traditional death metal style, the full length descends into crypts more dismal and necrotic than the demo, pushing their sound even deeper into funerary horror and despair&#8230;</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/19/announcement-10-wormridden-jp-dk/index.html">Announcement #10: WORMRIDDEN (jp/dk)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we have a special surprise for you… It´s one of those things that you might not ever get to see anywhere else, since this project consists of a guy from Japan and a guy from Denmark. Having only played one live show and that being in Tokyo, Japan, back in October 2014, KTDF is happy to present <strong>WORMRIDDEN</strong> for the first time live ever on European ground, when they make the floor shake during the Resurrection´s return of <strong>“Gloomy Sunday”</strong> this year!</p>
<p>Wormridden was formed during the aftermath of KTDF 2010 on a ferry from Denmark to Germany when Anatomia (jp) and Undergang (dk) played a few shows together following the first edition of the festival. Created with a combined love for the late 80’es/early 90’es Scandinavian heavy take on death metal, where the guitars were tuned as low as possible, drum beats were dragging slowly across moldy pavement only to explode in furious speed at surprising times and vocals so low and gurgling as humanly possible were the law, Wormridden aims at delivering equal disgusting chunk-loads of speaker liquefying death metal.</p>
<p>Join us, let your speakers dissolve while Wormridden is “<em>Rotting Beyond Belief”:<br />

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/18/announcement-9-rippikoulu-fin/index.html">Announcement #9: RIPPIKOULU (fin)!!!</a></h1>
		<p><strong>Announcement #9:</strong> we are back with another announcement for the <strong><em>Gloomy Sunday</em></strong> where we once again turn towards the mighty land of lakes, forrests and snow. The band we are presenting for you tonight has a long history and legacy spanning all the way back to the early 90´ies. We bring you none other than <strong>RIPPIKOULU </strong>performing their legendary 2<sup>nd</sup> demo <em>“Musta Seremonia” </em><em>in its entirety!<br />
</em><br />
Rippikoulu was formed in 1990 in Valkeakoski, Finland. Originally a punk/metal hybrid, but as a few band members changed they evolved into a metal band. Rippikoulu played music which is difficult to define mixing genres to their very own unique brand of slow punk fuelled death metal and were the first death metal band to sing in Finnish.</p>
<p>They released their first demo <em>”Mutaation Aiheuttama Ssäinen Mätäneminen” </em>in 1992 follwed by the now classic demo <em>”<u>Musta seremonia”</u> </em>demo in 1993. Both demos were distributed and sold worldwide.</p>
<p>When the band&#8217;s guitarist Marko Henriksson died in 1995, Rippikoulu was on hold for two years. Comeback attempts were made later but it wasn&#8217;t the same without Marko and therefore they ultimately split-up.</p>
<p>After re-releasing <em>“Musta Seremonia”</em> through Svart Records in 2010 the band decided to re-united is currently active again with their most memorable performance being Finnish Death Metal Maniacs Fest in 2015 and 2017.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/17/announcement-8-grave-miasma/index.html">Announcement #8: GRAVE MIASMA (uk)!!!</a></h1>
		<p><strong>Announcement #8;</strong> a lot has happened since 2011 where the band we are about announce played KTDF; a full length, a MLP, tours in Europe, US, South America and Australia. These guys are legends on the international underground scene and need no further introduction. We are proud to announce that UK´s no. 1 occult death metal entity <strong>GRAVE MIASMA</strong> will join us for a cavernous sonic ritual at KTDF 2018!</p>
<p>Formed in London, England in 2002 under the name of <strong>Goat Molestör</strong> they released  their first demo tape, <em>Ancient Barbaric Assault</em> as well as the <em>Realm Of Evoked Doom</em> 7&#8243; in 2005.</p>
<p>The band changed its name to Grave Miasma in 2006 and eventually released the <em>Exalted Emanation</em> MLP on September 9th 2009 on Sepulchral Voice Records. The <em>Realm Of Evoked Doom</em> EP was later re-released on CD with improved sound by Nuclear Winter Records.</p>
<p>After a small break and a handful of gigs and tours in Europe and the USA, Grave Miasma released their debut full-length album entitled <em>Odori Sepulcrorum</em> on 13.9.13. This was released by Sepulchral Voice Records in Europe and Profound Lore Records in the USA. The band embarked on a 14-date European tour with Necros Christos shortly after.</p>
<p>In 2016 Grave Miasma released the <em>“Endless Pilgrimage”</em> MLP following up their <em>&#8220;Odori Sepulcrorum&#8221;</em> milestone album by taking their sound further into darker, more atmospheric and more progressive territory channeling some of their most challenging, aggressive, and most advanced material to date. With <em>“Endless Pilgrimage”</em>, Grave Miasma have harnessed a new level of creativity to their oeuvre creating another unparalleled work within the genre.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/16/announcement-6-phrenelith-dk/index.html">Announcement #7: PHRENELITH (dk)!</a></h1>
		<p>We are back with our 7<sup>th</sup> announcement; in the last couple of years Copenhagen has seen a rise of a small but very promising underground death metal scene with a few bands that already from their first demos have been getting attention from abroad. The road was paved by Undergang and the band we are about to announce is also sharing a member with this exact band. We are thrilled to present to you Copenhagen´s very own <strong>PHRENELITH!</strong></p>
<p>Phrenelith was formed sometime in the year 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark and was rehearsal dwelling for most of the year, before recording their two track debut demo in over a time span of 3 months. The demo was released 3 months later through Extremely Rotten Productions in March 2015. Not long after they recruited their bassist and started playing gigs and a 2<sup>nd</sup> demo entitled <em>“Veiled Verses”</em> was recorded as a 4 piece and released later in 2015. The band has so far been on 2 European tours, one 2 weeks tour on the US West Coast and played several one off shows. The band released their debut album <em>&#8220;Desolate Endscape&#8221;</em> in early 2017 and received a good deal of attention and are currently brewing on several new planned releases.</p>
<p>Phrenelith plays a dark, filthy, low tuned, blackened, raw brand of death metal spiked with dual death grunts, not for anyone craving clarity or pleasant production values. Always with the memorable riffs in focus and drums varying from steamrolling slowness to meat grinding speed, Phrenelith aims at making your ears and eyes bleed.</p>
<p>Check out <em>&#8220;Dysmorphosis&#8221;</em> from <em>&#8220;Desolate Endscape&#8221;</em> : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8mFqp6tmz8&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL1miPiWXFl6g5w524Dz7kyvs9LV6AB4bQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8mFqp6tmz8&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL1miPiWXFl6g5w524Dz7kyvs9LV6AB4bQ</a><br />

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/15/119/index.html">Announcement #6: BLOOD INCANTATION (us)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we are extremely stoked to bring you one of the best contemporary death metal bands around – all the way from weed capital of the world Denver, Colorado &#8211; none other than the mind-blowing entity known as <strong>BLOOD INCANTATION!!!</strong></p>
<p>Blood Incantation was formed in 2011 and consists of vocalist and guitarist Paul Riedl, guitarist Morris Kolontyrsky, drummer Isaac Faulk and bassist Jeff Barrett. Their debut album, <em>Starspawn</em>, was released in 2016 through Dark Descent Records and received critical acclaim from music publications such as Decibel and Stereogum.</p>
<p>The band&#8217;s sound features <em>&#8220;a psychedelic take on classic death metal&#8221;</em> and melds <em>&#8220;technicality with tectonic riffs, cavernous vocals and eerie, Dodsengel-like moments of caustic stillness.&#8221;</em> On the band&#8217;s style, Stereogum&#8217;s Aaron Lariviere wrote: <em>&#8220;Screaming leads cut a swath through the churn of atonal rhythm guitars, blending the bright melodicism of late-period Death with the alien tones of Morbid Angel circa Domination.&#8221;</em> The band&#8217;s lyrics mainly deal with topics such as space, death, ancient civilizations and the big conspiracies of the world.</p>
<p>Since the release of<em> Starspawn</em>, Blood Incantation has been touring extensively around the world with several North American and European tours and a Australian mini tour under their belt. The band will return to Europe this summer and fall to do a round of festivals across the European continent ending their crusade at KTDF!</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2018/01/14/announcement-5-venenum-d/index.html">Announcement #5: VENENUM (d)!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we are bringing you our 5<sup>th</sup> announcement; it´s with great pleasure that we can present to you a band that in our humble opinion put out one of the best releases of 2017. It´s also a band we have been trying to get to KTDF since their self-titled EP blew us away in 2011 with their eclectic take on death metal. Tonight we bring you the mighty <strong>VENENUM!</strong></p>
<p>Formed in Nürnberg, Germany in 2008 from the ashes of the too soon defunct Excoriate, Venenum strikes mercilessly with their Heavy Metal of Death! In March 2017 they finally released their much anticipated debut album “Trance of Death” through Sepulchral Voice Records. The album had been 6 year in the making following their highly praised self-titled debut EP. “Trance of Death” is a masterpiece of epic proportions and has hit several top 10 lists of 2017. With such an album under their belt, one can assume that Venenum is a band that for sure will leave its mark in the Death Metal legacy. Mixing asphyxiating riffs of heaviness and eerie passages of morbid darkness, Venenum definitely knows how to combine the best of death and darkness into their age-old Metal cauldron.</p>
<p>Massively praised by the relevant music press and many veterans (i.e. Fenriz and Frank Stöver), Venenum started touring across Europe with bands such as Sonne Adam, Tribulation/Ketzer/Alchemyst, Watain/Degial and latest in April with Reveal from Sweden. Additionally they have played dozens of club shows and festivals in the North, South, East, and West, of Europe like Hells Pleasure, Party San Open Air, Wolfthrone Festival, Hell Over Hammaburg etc., always convincing with their stunning live shows and remarkable appearances. In February of 2018 they will hit the roads of Europe once again with Denmarks own Slægt for the “Europe in Trance tour”.</p>
