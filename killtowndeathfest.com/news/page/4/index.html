	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/20/announcement-11-first-live-performance-outside-israel-for-kever-il/index.html">Announcement #11: first live performance outside Israel for KEVER (il)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we will turn focus on the small, but quite active and productive death metal scene of Tel Aviv, Israel. With bands like Sonne Adam, Venemous Skeleton, Mortuus Umbra to name a few, the little core of people have been putting out a lot of good records over the last 10 years. The band we are about to announce feature core members of this scene and their name is the Hebrew word for “grave”, so it’s a given they had to play KTDF. We are excited to present the very first live performance outside Israel for the dark death metal entity known as <strong>KEVER!!!</strong></p>
<p>Kever came into existence in 2013 as continuation to Morbid Tendency, a one man project by Alex Lev. After teaming up with Tom Davidov (Sonne Adam) during that year, the MLP <em>&#8220;Eon of Cycling Death&#8221;</em> was released by Me Saco un Ojo Records and Dark Descent Records to great underground acclaim.</p>
<p>As time went on, Chen Dahan (Sonne Adam) joined on bass and the band started to play live as a trio, until Tom Cohen (Mortuus Umbra) joined as 2nd guitarist and Asaf Meiden (Har, Mortuus Umbra, ex-Sonne Adam) joined as a permanent drummer, bringing new influences that helped to expand the borders of the band’s sound, while keeping its roots in classic death metal.</p>
<p>Kever started as a raw, old-school oriented death metal band, but eventually evolved into its own entity with a more atmospheric approach, lyrically dealing with the ancient and the hidden aspects of our world and beyond.</p>
<p>5 years after the debut EP’s release, the long awaited <em>&#8220;Primordial Offerings&#8221;</em> MLP will be released in early 2019 on vinyl and CD, by Imperium Productions and Dark Descent Records respectively.</p>
<p>The band has already shared the stage locally with such acts as Dead Congregation, Grave Miasma, Blood Incantation and is now ready to raise their banner on foreign stages as well.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/19/announcement-10-first-european-performance-ever-for-suffering-hour-us/index.html">Announcement #10: First European performance ever for SUFFERING HOUR (us)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we are turning our focus back to America and the abundance of great death metal bands that still hasn’t set foot in Europe. We are extremely proud to announce one of the most anticipated first time performances on European soil for a while. A lot people guessed that they would have been included in last year’s line-up due to their epic 2017 full-length debut LP, but we didn’t manage until this year to get them over here. We are of course talking about <strong>SUFFERING HOUR!!!</strong></p>
<p>Suffering Hour is a Black/Death metal band from Minneapolis, USA. Formed as a thrash metal band in 2010 under a previous moniker, the trio steadily began delving into the darker depths of black metal and death metal. The band masters the craft of establishing a dark, mysterious and unsettling atmosphere with its dense and dissonant brand of blackened death metal; strange bending melodies and colossal doom-death riffs are blanketed in a thick, tar-like ooze, creating an ominous vibe.</p>
<p>2017 saw the release of their debut full length <em>&#8220;In Passing Ascension&#8221; </em>on Blood Harvest records to high critical acclaim. Quickly gaining recognition from the album and its unique and excellently crafted song writing, Suffering Hour started playing a handful of scattered live shows in the US in 2018, opening for a slew of heavy hitters and most notably: Covenant Fest in Montreal and Maryland Deathfest. Suffering Hour will be releasing a new EP on Blood Harvest in 2019 and continuing their live expeditions far and wide.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/18/announcement-9-corpsessed-fin-to-play-ktdf-2019/index.html">Announcement #9: Corpsessed (fin) to play KTDF 2019!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we will travel up to the forests of Finland to find the next act we are presenting for the KTDF 2019 line-up. The band has played KTDF back in 2012, but since they just put out one of the best death metal releases of 2018 we thought it was about time to invite them back. We are of course talking about the great defenders of oldschool Finnish death metal; <strong>CORPSESSED!!!</strong></p>
<p>Corpsessed plays abyssal and harrowing death metal, drawing influences and combining the suffocating and crushing tones of doom metal, and the ghastly ominousness of black metal and horror movie soundtracks &#8211; weaving it all within the style of rotting and brutal early 90s oldschool death metal, especially in the Finnish style and tradition. This is what CORPSESSED are all about.</p>
<p>Corpsessed was spawned from putrescent slime in 2007 at the rotting houses of delta-area  Järvenpää, Finland. The 5-piece band started honing their abyssal death metal tunes and officially released their first EP titled <em>&#8220;The Dagger &amp; The Chalice&#8221;</em> on CD by Dark Descent Records (USA) and on vinyl by Me Saco Un Ojo (UK) in 2011.</p>
<p>Corpsessed&#8217;s debut full length album titled <em>&#8220;Abysmal Thresholds&#8221;</em> was released in the beginning of 2014, and strengthened the band as one of the current torch bearers of Finnish death metal.</p>
<p>2018 saw the year of the bands second full-length <em>&#8220;Impetus of Death&#8221;</em>, an album that manages to top it its predecessors in terms of heaviness and brutality while taking their epic sound a step further.</p>
<p>The band is known for their dark brand of death metal that harks back to the old days of early 90s and has received high praise for their hard-hitting and suffocating live shows, appearing in such festivals as Netherlands DeathFest (NL), Tuska Open Air (Fin), Obscene Extreme Fest (CZ), SteelFest (Fin), Kill-Town DeathFest (DK), and NRW DeathFest (Ger) throughout the past 7 years.</p>
<p>The band has also played 2 successful European Tours with Cruciamentum (in 2015) and Undergang (in 2018).</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/17/announcement-8-one-off-exclusive-euro-performance-by-mortuous-us/index.html">Announcement #8: one-off exclusive Euro performance by MORTUOUS (us)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we will go back over the Atlantic to present another band of the flourishing American death metal scene. Even though this band can’t be categorised as new, it’s mainly in the last couple of years that they have really caught our attention, especially with their epic 2018 debut LP. With members and ex members of such prominent bands as Exhumed, Repulsion, Necrot, Vastum and Scolex to name a few – this is a band that delivers! Therefor we are extremely stoked to be bringing you the very first and one-off exclusive European performance of San Jose, California’s, <strong>MORTUOUS!!!</strong></p>
<p>Mortuous formed in 2009 from the ashes of Colin Tarvin’s previous project Funerealm in the hope of creating a new death metal band. He started writing music in the vein of Incantation, Autopsy, and Viogression with lyrics emphasizing heavily on philosophical views on death and anti-technological themes. Later that year he released the demo, “Mors Immortalis”, on Skeleton Plague Records which received praise and recognition throughout the underground death metal community. By 2010, Mortuous had a full lineup which included Col Jones and Mike Beams, previously of Exhumed, Al Tarvin-Kibler, and Nick Scarboro. In 2013, Mortuous parted ways with Al and Nick and recruited Clint Roach on Bass. By 2014, Mortuous saw the current lineup formation with the addition of Chad Gailey (Necrot) on drums. In November of 2016, Mortuous went into Earhammer Studios with Greg Wilkinson to record their first Full-Length LP entitled, “Through Wilderness”, which features eight new tracks of total doom and death metal with nods to such bands as My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, Rottrevore, and diSEMBOWELMENT. “Through Wilderness” was released in June 2018 through Carbonized and Tankcrimes Records in the United States. Dawnbreed and Extremely Rotten Productions handled the European release respectfully. In September 2018, Mortuous released a split 7” record with Scolex which made its debut at Kil-Town Death Fest VI &#8211; The Resurrection!</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/16/announcement-7-ignivomous-aus/index.html">Announcement #7: Ignivomous (aus)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>The next announcement comes from all the way down under and will be a rare opportunity to bare witness to. This will be only the third international onslaught in the bands’s tenure &#8211; a decade since their last incursion upon European soil. Therefor we are very pleased to bring to you a band that spews forth some of the most focused and abysmally brutal death metal ever unleashed – all the way from Australia; <strong>IGNIVOMOUS!!!</strong></p>
<p>Borne out of the members desire to see a resurgence of a heavier, more dissonant style of death metal, Ignivomous were among the first bands in what has since become a recognized movement (and revival) of murky, dense death metal.</p>
<p>Formed in 2006, Australians Ignivomous quickly issued a cassette version of their Path of Attrition demo which soon after sold out. The band then signed to cult US label Nuclear War Now! who re-issued Path of Attrition on vinyl, followed by their debut full-length album <em>Death Transmutation</em> in 2008 and sophomore <em>Contragenesis</em> in 2011.</p>
<p><em>Heiroglossia</em>, their third full-length opus, is scheduled for production in 2019, featuring — in addition to founding members Chris Volcano, Sean Hinds and Jael Edwards — Lewis Fischer (Altars) and Chris Jordon (Inverloch). Anticipate a churning maelstrom of blast beat laden savagery and harrowing doom passages. Raw death metal building firmly from their own legacy and pushing further into the void. Hostile, sinister and spiteful, as the name translates: vomiting fire.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/15/announcement-6-coffins-jp-to-headline-gloomy-sunday/index.html">Announcement #6: Coffins (jp) to headline &#8220;Gloomy Sunday&#8221;!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we will present the headliner of our “Gloomy Sunday” event taking place on Sunday 8th. As most of you probably know already the “Gloomy Sunday” is our cool down day where we focus on doom/death and funeral doom. The band we are about to announce have been on our want list for years, but for some reason we have never made it happen up until this moment. They played the KTDF warm-up party last year and have prevoiusly played out sister festival Heavy Days in Doomtown (RIP) and now we can finally announce them for KTDF too! We are of course talking about the legendary Japanese doom/death outfit <strong>COFFINS!!!<br />
</strong><br />
Coffins formed in 1996 and has since scavenged the depths of evil and darkness throughout their decade-plus existence as they slowly work toward a flawless refinement of all the things we love about the genre. According to Exclaim!, Coffins might not innovate but instead “reanimate one of the darkest, most oppressive chapters of metal with consummate style and punishing panache.” Band members have displayed their immense talent and power since their debut full-length, <em>Mortuary in Darkness</em>, released on Razorback Recordings in 2005. A year later, they followed up with their sophomore release, <em>The Other Side of Blasphemy</em>, released through Imperium Productions. This album managed to somehow increase the heaviness of Mortuary, but it wasn’t until 2008’s <em>Buried Death</em> that the band truly reached the sonic nirvana they had been aiming at since their beginnings.</p>
<p><em>Buried Death</em>, which Metal Reviews referred to as “satisfyingly heavy” as well as “raw and nasty,” was released through 20 Buck Spin and would be the band’s final full-length before signing to Relapse Records in early 2011. Before the signing, Coffins spread their sound across an enormous amount of split-releases with such acclaimed acts as Warhammer, StormCrow, and Hooded Menace. Additionally, the band has performed shows with bands such as Yob and Kylesa, and has made appearances at Roadburn Afterburner and Los Angeles Murder Fest. Coffins also just finished a massive European tour, following thorough excursions in the east and west coasts as well as a successful tour in Australia.</p>
<p>In 2013, Coffins released their fourth full-length and Relapse Records debut <em>The Fleshland</em>. A refreshing and mind-bending amalgamation of doom and death metal’s greatest moments, the LP shows Coffins smashing down everything in their path with nine grisly tracks.  Since then they have released no less than 6 splits, 2 EP´s and one compilation.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/14/announcement-5-exclusive-euro-performance-for-antediluvian-can/index.html">Announcement #5: One-off Euro performance for ANTEDILUVIAN (can)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Tonight we shift our focus back to Canada where we have an exclusive treat for you guys up our sleeve. The band we are about to announce performs very rarely and the appearance at KTDF will be one out of a few select performances in 2019 which are the first since 2015! They have been on our want list for many years so being able to finally present a one-off European performance is a tremendous honour! It’s with great pleasure we bring you one of Canadas most obscure extreme metal entities; <strong>ANTEDILUVIAN!!!</strong></p>
<p>Known for an uncompromisingly unique aesthetic, Canadian experimental Black Death outfit Antediluvian exemplifies the true ethos of Satanic expression through original and creative song writing and visual presentation. Their style incorporates baffling time signatures, dissonant riffing, woven in intricately structured rhythmic chaos. The music is a fitting compliment to the adversarial ideologies presented by accompanying lyrics and art. These themes encompass existential terror, transgression, and death worship, to create entheogenic nightmares of spiritual disturbance.  With two full lengths and a slew of EPs behind them, Antediluvian look forward to the release of their third album as well as a new split and EP in the coming year. Dormant from the gigging circuit since 2015, they return with their strongest live presentation yet, appearing in 2019 in Europe at Killtown Death Fest September 5 &#8211; 8 and in North America at Covenant Festival, July 4 &#8211; 6.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/13/announcement-4-obliteration/index.html">Announcement #4: OBLITERATION (no)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>Today we are excited to welcome back for the second time one of Scandinavia’s finest death metal outfits who also happened to put one of the best releases of 2018! The band we are about to announce played the very first and the very last edition of KTDF before calling it quits in 2015, and were in fact the first band to ever be confirmed to play this fest. We honour our long lasting friendship and collaboration by bringing them back once again for your enjoyment. It’s with great pleasure that we can welcome back Norways very own; <strong>OBLITERATION!!!</strong></p>
<p>Death metal quartet Obliteration is from Kolbotn, Norway &#8211; home of Darkthrone, Aura Noir, Lamented Souls among others. The band started out in 2001 and have ever since left a trail of destruction behind them with hellblazing gigs and rock solid releases. After a rehearsal demo in 2006 Obliteration were asked to sign with cult label Tyrant Syndicate, a sub-label of Peaceville Records, which is run by Nocturno Culto of Darkthrone. Obliteration released the debut album <em>&#8220;Perpetual Decay&#8221;</em> in May 2007 which got great reviews worldwide, and a UK tour with doomsters Ramesses followed.</p>
<p>In 2009 Obliteration unleashed upon this earth their second album, <em>“Nekrospalms”</em> through the Norwegian label Fysisk Format. Nekropsalms was recorded by the band themselves in their own studio at Kolbotn in one week, DIY style. Nekropsalms is a cosmic blend of old school death metal mixed with the best elements from doom, punk, thrash and old school black metal, and after 8 years, Obliteration have finally found their own repulsive style. The album got rave reviews world wide, both in the underground and in more mainstreem circuits. Nekropsalms was awarded &#8220;album of the year&#8221; in Norwegian magazine <em>“Natt og Dag”</em> in 2009, and won Osloprisen for best album in 2009. <em>“Well well well, what we have here is the second album of the Kolbotn maniacs, and they have with this recording succeeded at what we in Darkthrone attempted on our “Soulside Journey” and “Goatlord” albums – a death metal masterpiece&#8221;</em> &#8211; Fenriz of Darkthrone.</p>
<p>After the release of Nekropsalms, Obliteration spread their dark message throughout the earth, touring USA and the UK and had several festival apperances at Maryland Death Fest, Hole in the Sky, Øya Festivalen, Live Evil, Kill-Town Death Fest, several one-off shows and so forth.<br />
In 2013 Obliteration returned after a three year hiatus with another devastating monument of death. Recorded once again in their own DIY studio at Kolbotn, to capture the band&#8217;s fire on tape, <em>“Black Death Horizon”</em> delivered seven sepulchral tracks of haunting death metal.</p>
<p>2018 saw the release of  the fourth album <em>&#8220;Cenotaph Obscure”</em> further expanding on the quartet&#8217;s trademark sound; lead heavy old-school death metal with distinct flavours of both doom and black metal. Inventive yet never difficult to grasp, technical without wankery and obscure without being diffuse, Obliteration are masters at their craft. Cenotaph Obscure was recorded in Studio Cobra, Stockholm with Martin &#8220;Konie&#8221; Ehrencrona at the helm, lending the album an organic yet in your face production. In perfect keeping with the music, the lyrics deal with dystopic, apocalyptic themes, extinct civilizations and interdimensional portals etc. With Cenotaph Obscure, Obliteration cement their status as leaders in the Norwegian death metal scene, delivering a grizzly yet flawless monument to Death metal the way it was meant to be; obscure, ominous and unpredictable.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/12/announcement-3-one-off-exclusive-european-performance-for-vastum/index.html">Announcement #3: one-off exclusive european performance for VASTUM (us)!!!</a></h1>
		<p>So tonight we turn our focus towards The States and will present a band that got so excited when the festival sold out the other day, that they announced themselves… So now that the cat is out of the bag we are proud to welcome a one-off exclusive European performance for Bay Are favorites; <strong>VASTUM!!!</strong><u><br />
</u><br />
Death Metal quintet Vastum hails from Oakland, Califormia and have released 3 albums since 2011 via 20 Buck Spin.  The current lineup consists of bassist Luca Indrio (Necrot, Acephalix), guitarist/vocalist Leila Abdul-Rauf (Hammers of Misfortune, Cardinal Wyrm), vocalist Daniel Butler (Acephalix), guitarist Shelby Lermo (Ulthar, Extremity) and drummer Chad Gailey (Necrot, Mortuous).</p>
<p>Vastum’s uniquely crushing brutality is enhanced via lyrical prowess on the subjects of sexuality, eroticism, psychoanalysis and the writings of George Bataille among others. If not the for the extremely debased barbarity of the music one might rightly consider Vastum a thinking man’s Death Metal band. Instead the band is an avalanche of punishment, bodily fluids, caved in skulls and naked violence.</p>
<p>The band is noted for its energetic live performance which hits you hard straight in the face. Musically, the band&#8217;s releases feature death metal and dark atmospheres based on slow to mid-tempo, grinding grooves, interspersed with up-tempo shifts, and a bellowing, enunciated growl. The band&#8217;s third studio album, Hole Below, was listed as number 19 on Pitchfork&#8217;s list of &#8220;The Best Metal Albums of 2015&#8221;.  A fourth full length is slated to be released on 20 Buck Spin in late 2019.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../2019/01/11/announcement-2-for-the-first-time-in-europe-ever-tomb-mold-can/index.html">Announcement #2: for the first time in Europe ever; Tomb Mold (can)!</a></h1>
		<p>Are you ready for our second announcement? We are still trying to comprehend what happened yesterday, but that won’t change the fact that we have 39 more bands to announce… So let’s start off with one of our Canadian bands! As many of you most likely have guessed, we have had our eyes and ears locked in on this new entity spawning from Toronto who reared their ugly head for the first time back in 2016. They have been very busy since then, storming forward and gaining a following around the globe in such short time. Now the time has come for their crusade to continue overseas…Therefor we are extremely excited to present for the first time in Europe ever –<strong>TOMB MOLD!!!</strong></p>
<p>Canadian death metal band Tomb Mold started as a 2 person project. Having played music together over numerous years, Derrick and Max knew exactly how they wanted to approach this, both from a sound and visual perspective. The goal was simply recording one or two demo tapes and then calling it a day. So much for that. Due to an overwhelming response to “The Bottomless Perdition”, they decided to work with Blood Harvest on “Primordial Malignity” to continue building their sound using the foundation of Finnish style death metal, their first full length. After the 2nd tape “The Moulting”, they turned Tomb Mold into a 4 piece touring band adding long-time friends and former band-mates Steve and Payson on bass and guitar respectively. Their 2nd full length was released with 20 Buck Spin, and “Manor of Infinite Forms” showcases their departure from playing a specific style of death metal and just writing anything they feel comfortable with. As the label puts it, &#8220;Constructing monumental towers of obscure shape, jarring yet coherent, Tomb Mold compositions evoke a distorted world alongside our own where all manner of oddity and peculiarity are permitted.&#8221; It also continued to build on the cosmic, insectoid infected universe they have been building through their music with the help of Brad Moore&#8217;s legendary artwork. Since then they have started touring and playing fests and have had the opportunity to tour with top tier bands like Horrendous and Of Feather and Bone. Continuing on with this momentum, expect to see more music released in 2019.</p>
