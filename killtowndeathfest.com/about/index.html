	<h1>About</h1>
	<p><strong>Kill-Town Death fest</strong> is a Danish underground Death Metal festival that seeks to promote underground Death Metal bands.</p>
<p><strong>KTDF</strong> is a celebration of the current underground Death Metal scenes, the active bands, and the people involved. Our goal is to create a festival that puts the focus back on the music and the bands by presenting the new, young demo bands along with the old favorites. We want to make it possible for underground Death Metal bands to reach a broader audience, beyond their national borders. By doing so we hope to create an international exchange amongst non-commercial underground Death Metal scenes.</p>
<p><strong>KTDF</strong> strives to be an alternative to the corporate music business and commercial, larger scale festivals. All of the work that is put into the process of organization is volunteer based, and everyone you will see working from the KTDF team during the festival are volunteers as well. The people from the venue working the bars and security are paid by the venue. All of the money raised during the festival goes to covering festival costs such as gear, travel costs, food, and accommodation for the bands. If there is a residual profit, it will go into creating the festival next year. The structure of the festival organization is based on participatory democracy, so that all volunteers can have an influence on the shaping and evolving of the festival.</p>
<p><strong>International dimension<br />
</strong>In the past decade there has been a rise of a new young generation of bands within the international underground Death Metal scenes. Many bands have risen and the need to tour and get exposure is increasing.</p>
<p>Kill-Town Death Fest is an attempt to encourage this by creating a platform, and functioning as a channel for not only Scandinavian but also International Death Metal bands who may not necessarily have the means or opportunities to reach a broader audience. We want to facilitate this by showcasing bands at the festival, prompting them to gain exposure in a non-commercial way.</p>
<p>The festival wishes to promote international co-operation between bands, bookers, record labels and zines. Through that, looking to create an exchange of ideas, experiences, inspiration and knowledge. We want to build upon existing networks, while at the same time trying to expand and include new people, bands and initiatives that can contribute to the creation of this event, thus strengthening non-commercial underground culture.</p>
<p>The line-up is carefully built up of hand-picked bands, all of which are exclusively brought in for this event. Transportation costs are therefore the biggest part of our budget, as it’s expensive to transport non-touring bands here and back. It is of the utmost importance for the festival to present a varied line-up consisting solely of international underground Death Metal bands.</p>
<p><strong>The Undergrundsmusikkens Fremme Association<br />
</strong>Kill-Town Death Fest is an initiative undertaken by the “Undergrundsmusikkens Fremme” Association. “Undergrundsmusikkens Fremme” is an association started by young people from Copenhagen, all of whom have backgrounds in underground music. The purpose of the group is to create a platform that will enhance exposure, and spread the knowledge and culture of underground music. The primary goal of the association is to put forth non-commercial cultural activities such as concerts, festivals and other events, with a focus on underground music.</p>
<p>The association is cultural-political and through its events strive to pass on information and show alternative ways of creating and promoting culture. The association is run by a group of music enthusiasts, all sharing a common vision of creating non-commercial culture. It, like KTDF itself, is based on volunteers. So no-one is paid for their work within the activities of the association. The association is also structured around the principles of base-democracy, with no leadership and participatory democracy around weekly meetings. The association is open to everyone; all those who show up and participate can take part in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>We are a diverse group of people of different ages, backgrounds and experiences. We started this project together because we all share a passion for creating culture in an alternative way. By contributing personal experience, as well as learning from each other’s experiences we are all participating in the process of developing this festival as well as tackling the many tasks that come with organizing such an event.</p>
<p><strong>A different festival<br />
</strong>The idea behind festival is to create an event that will be the frame for underground Death Metal bands who, for the most part, doesn’t fit in with the programming of commercial venues, and to fill the void that exists in Scandinavia concerning a method of exposure for underground bands.</p>
<p>The festival wishes to give our guests and performing artists a different kind of festival experience, by creating a space where everyone can feel welcome regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age or economic/cultural background.</p>
<p>The festival thus intends to contribute on two levels; namely, by creating a channel for underground Death Metal that doesn’t exist already, showing that music and culture <em>can</em> be about more than money and commercial interests. At the same time, we are actively trying to create an atmosphere around the festival that is tolerant, open, gives space for diversity and that can aspire to a different way of interacting where for example people of colour, women or homosexuals don’t have to feel uncomfortable nor experience harassment.</p>
