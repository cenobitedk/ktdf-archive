	<h1>“KILL-TOWN DEATH FEST VI &#8211; THE RESURRECTION”</h1>
	<p><b>WE ARE BAAAACK…! </b>Kill-Town Death Fest will resurrect from the dead in September 2018!!! The sewers of Copenhagen will once more overflow with the rotting, festering slime of the ugliest death metal this planet has to offer!</p>
<p>3 ½ years has gone by since “The Funeral Edition”. Back then we decided to call it quits due to what we felt was a lack of good contemporary death metal bands, so we decided to quit while we were ahead instead of just repeating the same bands over and over again. A lot has happened in the 3 ½ years and we feel that there has been a revitalization of the death metal underground with a resurgence of excellent new young bands which makes KTDF relevant again. So we have decided to pick up where we left off and for the last 6 months we have been working hard on building what is now shaping up to be one of the finest festivals we have done so far.</p>
<p>Therefore we are proud to announce that<b> “KILL-TOWN DEATH FEST VI &#8211; THE RESURRECTION”</b> will take place from <b>6th – 9th of September 2018</b>!! 4 days of death, 35 bands, 3 stages, distros, food, drinks and the best and most dedicated crowd!</p>
<p>Where our focus previously was mainly on the Scandinavian scene, this year we will put a lot of our focus on North America where we think a lot of great new young bands are rearing their ugly heads. With Dark Descent Records, 20 Buck Spin, Profound Lore Records, Tankcrimes Records and many other great supportive labels we have seen a revival of great young American death metal bands who are storming forward. We will be bringing over a bunch of bands that have never played Europe before, so you will get a unique one-of-a-kind experience! We have also been digging through the old archives and found a few nice treats that will resurrect from the dead just to come play KTDF exclusively! On the bill you will find a few bigger names as well as the young demo bands and those in between. As always we will round off the whole event with the “Gloomy Sunday” where a selection of doom/death and funeral doom bands will bash your hangover deeper into your skull!</p>
<p>With the resurrection of KTDF we have decided to change the location of the fest. We still love Ungdomshuset and it served as a great venue for the first 5 editions, but now we have decided to relocate the festival to the mighty Pumpehuset right in the city center of Copenhagen – 1 min from the Central Square and 5 min from the central station with plenty of accommodation options right nearby. Besides being a great venue with 3 stages (2 in door and 1 outdoor) and the nicest employees, Pumpehuset served as the central spot for the golden era of death metal in the 90´ies. Many great bands have played there over the years such as Death, Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Entombed, Morbid Angel, etc. to just name a few who played in their prime. We are honoured to bring the contemporary death metal scene back to this glorious venue for a weekend celebration of death!</p>
<p>KTDF will keep being as idealistic as we have always been and the fest is still being organized by a collective of volunteer die hards. Due to the change of location to a professional venue we will not need the same amount of volunteers as we did for the previous editions. There will still be some volunteers needed, so get in touch if you want to help out as soon as you see a post about volunteering via our FB and website channels. The ticket price will also see a slight increase &#8211; although we would like to make it as cheap as possible, we are only able to sell 600 tickets so that limits us quite a bit and therefore we have had to raise the price. We hope you all understand.</p>
<p>We will start the band announcements on January 10th and we’ll squeeze out presentations of the individual bands over the time following the announcement. Presale will start on the 10th as well at 12.00 CET. Be quick because there will only be 600 tickets for sale – as soon as they are gone, that’s it! At the same time we will launch our website <a href="../../../../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.killtowndeathfest.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515665487639000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiWHeVE10ki5gtUQIOI3igwsw4Fw">www.killtowndeathfest.<wbr />com</a> where you can find all relevant information about the fest, plus news and updates.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited about this as we are!<br />
