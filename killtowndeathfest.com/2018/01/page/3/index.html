	<h1><a href="../../12/pissgrave-us-to-hit-ktdf-as-3rd-announcement/index.html">PISSGRAVE to hit KTDF as 3rd announcement!</a></h1>
	<p>Today we’re disgustingly delighted to present for only the second time in Europe, Philadelphia filth mongers <strong>PISSGRAVE!</strong> They gathered a lot of attention and positive response from the repulsive debut album “Suicide Euphoria” back in 2015 and evil tongues sedates us with poisonous words about there being a new album on the horizon and we dare say that there’ll be new songs presented live at this year’s KTDF!</p>
<p>The band was formed by the twin brothers Tim (guitar and vocals) and Matt (drums) and they started out as a duo playing live shows in Philadelphia and surroundings. They later made a full line-up including Demian from heavy rockers Serpent Throne on guitar and their friend John on bass at the time, who has since been replaced by Brad, who’s earlier been the vocalist of Otesanek. The band gathered a bit of well deserved attention in their home country when they did a short East Coast tour with Greek death metal heavy weights,  Dead Congregation a few years back and they visited Europe for the first time in 2016 on a 2 week tour with Danish Phrenelith. They’ve been selective with what they’ve done and so far all they’ve done has impressed us and many others.</p>
<p>PISSGRAVE is fierce, raw, brutal and disturbing. Their music is violent and disgusting. PISSGRAVE is death metal when death metal turns REAL ugly and we salute and support that!</p>
<p>Find out for yourselves and get your ears mangled in the “Blood Fog”:<br />

	<h1><a href="../../11/necrot-to-play-first-ever-european-show-at-ktdf-vi/index.html">Necrot to play first ever European show at KTDF VI!</a></h1>
	<p>We are back with our second announcement; tonight we are proud to announce that Bay Area crushers <strong>NECROT</strong> will do their first ever European performance at KTDF – The Resurrection!</p>
<p>The last year has been active for <strong>NECROT</strong> after the release of their critically acclaimed debut album<em> <strong>“Blood Offerings”</strong></em> in the summer of 2017. They toured for more than 2 months around the US and Canada after the release promoting the album and after cancelling their European tour in October 2017, we’re excited that <strong>NECROT</strong> will spill their first ever Blood Offerings at KTDF 2018!</p>
<p>Back in 2011 Luca (bass &amp; vocals) and Chad (drums) started out recording and releasing their first two demos only consisting of the two as members, as they couldn’t find the right person to join the band on guitar to fit with what they had in mind. After having Luca play guitars on the recordings, they found local guitar-swinger Sonny to form the steady line-up to play and record their third and final demo “The Labyrinth” showed what was to come. Having always been busy keeping their presence visible in their local scene and both coasts of America, 2017 saw the release of their debut album “Blood Offerings” and first full US tour over the summer. The album gathered them a lot of well-deserved attention and soon after they were offered yet another big US tour supporting Suffocation forcing them to cancel their planned European tour that year. That will however now be changed as we have the honor of showing NECROT for the first time in Europe at KTDF 2018.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it; rip it up with NECROT to “Empty Hands”: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTNas0q5exI">www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTNas0q5exI</a><br />

	<h1><a href="../../10/77/index.html">DEMILICH (fin) announced as first band to play KTDF!!!</a></h1>
	<p><strong>THE PRESALE HAS COMMENCED!!!</strong></p>
<p>Follow this link to get your tickets:<br />
<a href="https://billetto.dk/e/kill-town-death-fest-vi-the-resurrection-billetter-252049">https://billetto.dk/e/kill-town-death-fest-vi-the-resurrection-billetter-252049</a></p>
<p>As promised here is the first announcement of KTDF; we are extremely proud and excited to announce that the masters of the Finnish death metal underground, <strong>DEMILICH</strong> will finally play Copenhagen for the very first time ever!!! They have been on our want list since we started and in September you will get a chance to see one of the most obscure death metal bands ever to have existed at KTDF!</p>
<p>Demilich have deservedly become one of the most legendary bands to emerge from the Finnish metal underground. While they are obscure in the grand scheme of things, they are well known in the metal underground and probably need no introduction to most underground death metal fans as they could be considered one of the most important bands in codifying the &#8220;dissonant and technical&#8221; strain of death metal alongside Quebec&#8217;s Gorguts.</p>
<p>The sheer experimentation of this music represents a progression of the genre of death metal that has seldom been equalled elsewhere, and the music is much more complex than it first appears on the surface.</p>
<p>The band was created in Kuopio, Finland during 1990, established by vocalist / guitarist Antti Boman, bass player Jussi Teräsvirta plus drummer Mikko Virnes. The cassette demos &#8216;Regurgitation Of Blood&#8217; and &#8216;The Four Instructive Tales&#8230; Of Decomposition&#8217; surfaced the following year, after which Barathrum guitarist Aki Hytönen was added to the roster. &#8216;&#8230;Somewhere Inside The Bowels Of Endlessness&#8230;&#8217; followed in 1992. In February 1993 Demilich released their debut album, &#8216;Nespithe&#8217; which has later become an underground classic. The band initially disbanded in 1993, but was resurrected in 2005-2006 again in 2010 and now active since 2014 with an American tour under their belt among several festival performances.</p>
<p>The band&#8217;s live performance is consistently fantastic; this is demanding material from a technical standpoint and the four members of Demilich are more than up to the challenge of performing it.</p>
<p>This music genuinely sounds like it was composed and performed by aliens! We welcome these Finnish aliens!</p>

	<h1><a href="../../10/kill-town-death-fest-vi-the-resurrection/index.html">“KILL-TOWN DEATH FEST VI &#8211; THE RESURRECTION”</a></h1>
	<p><b>WE ARE BAAAACK…! </b>Kill-Town Death Fest will resurrect from the dead in September 2018!!! The sewers of Copenhagen will once more overflow with the rotting, festering slime of the ugliest death metal this planet has to offer!</p>
<p>3 ½ years has gone by since “The Funeral Edition”. Back then we decided to call it quits due to what we felt was a lack of good contemporary death metal bands, so we decided to quit while we were ahead instead of just repeating the same bands over and over again. A lot has happened in the 3 ½ years and we feel that there has been a revitalization of the death metal underground with a resurgence of excellent new young bands which makes KTDF relevant again. So we have decided to pick up where we left off and for the last 6 months we have been working hard on building what is now shaping up to be one of the finest festivals we have done so far.</p>
<p>Therefore we are proud to announce that<b> “KILL-TOWN DEATH FEST VI &#8211; THE RESURRECTION”</b> will take place from <b>6th – 9th of September 2018</b>!! 4 days of death, 35 bands, 3 stages, distros, food, drinks and the best and most dedicated crowd!</p>
<p>Where our focus previously was mainly on the Scandinavian scene, this year we will put a lot of our focus on North America where we think a lot of great new young bands are rearing their ugly heads. With Dark Descent Records, 20 Buck Spin, Profound Lore Records, Tankcrimes Records and many other great supportive labels we have seen a revival of great young American death metal bands who are storming forward. We will be bringing over a bunch of bands that have never played Europe before, so you will get a unique one-of-a-kind experience! We have also been digging through the old archives and found a few nice treats that will resurrect from the dead just to come play KTDF exclusively! On the bill you will find a few bigger names as well as the young demo bands and those in between. As always we will round off the whole event with the “Gloomy Sunday” where a selection of doom/death and funeral doom bands will bash your hangover deeper into your skull!</p>
<p>With the resurrection of KTDF we have decided to change the location of the fest. We still love Ungdomshuset and it served as a great venue for the first 5 editions, but now we have decided to relocate the festival to the mighty Pumpehuset right in the city center of Copenhagen – 1 min from the Central Square and 5 min from the central station with plenty of accommodation options right nearby. Besides being a great venue with 3 stages (2 in door and 1 outdoor) and the nicest employees, Pumpehuset served as the central spot for the golden era of death metal in the 90´ies. Many great bands have played there over the years such as Death, Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Entombed, Morbid Angel, etc. to just name a few who played in their prime. We are honoured to bring the contemporary death metal scene back to this glorious venue for a weekend celebration of death!</p>
<p>KTDF will keep being as idealistic as we have always been and the fest is still being organized by a collective of volunteer die hards. Due to the change of location to a professional venue we will not need the same amount of volunteers as we did for the previous editions. There will still be some volunteers needed, so get in touch if you want to help out as soon as you see a post about volunteering via our FB and website channels. The ticket price will also see a slight increase &#8211; although we would like to make it as cheap as possible, we are only able to sell 600 tickets so that limits us quite a bit and therefore we have had to raise the price. We hope you all understand.</p>
<p>We will start the band announcements on January 10th and we’ll squeeze out presentations of the individual bands over the time following the announcement. Presale will start on the 10th as well at 12.00 CET. Be quick because there will only be 600 tickets for sale – as soon as they are gone, that’s it! At the same time we will launch our website <a href="../../../../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.killtowndeathfest.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515665487639000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGiWHeVE10ki5gtUQIOI3igwsw4Fw">www.killtowndeathfest.<wbr />com</a> where you can find all relevant information about the fest, plus news and updates.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited about this as we are!<br />
