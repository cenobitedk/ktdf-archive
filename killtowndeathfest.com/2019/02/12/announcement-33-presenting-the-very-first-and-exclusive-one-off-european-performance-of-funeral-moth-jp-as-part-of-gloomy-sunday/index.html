	<h1>Announcement #33: presenting the very first and exclusive one-off European performance of FUNERAL MOTH (jp) as part of Gloomy Sunday!!!</h1>
	<p>Tonight we will go back to Japan to present to you a very special surprise that we are very excited to share with you. For the past 20 years Makoto Fujishima has through his label Weird Truth Productions been releasing and pioneering funeral doom from around the globe with a series of excellent releases from bands such as Profetus, Worship, Funeralium and Imindain to name a few. At the same time he was also working on his own project which he releases through his own label. Despite being around for 15 years already they have never played in Europe, so therefor its an extreme honor for us to be able to present the very first and exclusive one-off European performance of <strong>FUNERAL MOTH</strong> as part of Gloomy Sunday!!!</p>
<p>Funeral Moth was formed by Nobuyuki Sentou (ex-Coffins/ex-Psycho To Black), Makoto Fujishima (ex-deathchurch/nyarlathotep), and Junpei Ishimaru (Morquido) in Autumn 2005. Funeral Moth&#8217;s debut live was held on May 3rd 2006 and shared the stage with some international bands like StarGazer(Aus), Gallhammer, Intestine Baalism among others. In November 2006, they recorded their 1st demo at Noise Room Studio, at which Nobuyuki recorded many several artists such as Coffins, Psycho To Black etc. &#8220;The Moth Flying to the Funeral Sky&#8221; was released by Makoto&#8217;s own label Weird Truth Productions.</p>
<p>In the end of 2007, Junpei left the band, but was soon after replaced by Yuichiro Azegami (Brob). With this new line-up, they re-recorded 2 songs as a demo which was released as a CD EP in June 2008 &#8211; same time as they shared the stage with German doom cult band Worship in Tokyo.</p>
<p>In July 2010, they toured with Australian doom band Mournful Congregation. During this tour, Takafumi Matsubara (Retortion Terror/ex-Gridlink/ex-Mortalized) joined as a special guest. After the tour, they started to look for a permanent 2nd guitar player and finally in January 2012 Mayo Odium (Dogoh/ex-Ssorc/ex-Stabat Mater) joined.</p>
<p>In July 2013, Mayo Odium left the band and was replaced by Tomohiro Kanja (Realm(Negativeaidguerrilla Realm)/Discrete Corporality). In February 2014, their 1st album &#8220;Dense Fog&#8221; was released and they toured with Worship again.</p>
<p>In February 2015, they played in Taipei which was the first time for Funeral Moth to play outside Japan. In May, 2008 the self titled EP was released as 12&#8243; vinyl by Chinese label Psychedelic Lotus Order and a 2x 12&#8243; vinyl version of the Dense Fog album was released by Spanish Throne Records. In July, they played at Fearest Death Cult, which is the one of the biggest DIY extreme music festival held in Osaka. After that gig, Nobuyuki left the band to concentrate on other things. He was replaced by bass player Ryo Amamiya (ex-Juki) and they released their 2nd album &#8220;Transience&#8221; in March 2016 again from Weird Truth Productions.</p>
