	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/30/announcement-21-very-first-european-bombardement-for-superstition-us/index.html">Announcement #21: very first European bombardement for SUPERSTITION (us)!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Tonight we turn our focus back towards the States, where we have the honour of presenting a very fresh new outfit with only a demo out so far, but a very promising one. They are in our humble opinion one of the most interesting new outfits to rear its ugly head from the thriving American death metal underground. We are therefor very excited to present to you the first bombardent on European soil for <strong>SUPERSTITION!!!</p>
<p></strong>Superstition was forged in the furnace of death to construct ripping evil in the classic vein of the Americas. Through the smoke of ruin, the four malefactors of the phantom swarm committed the <em>‘Surging Throng of Evil’s Might’</em> demo to tape in the dying moments of 2017. Charging themselves with upholding the menacing lunacy of early American bands such as Necrovore and Possessed, Superstition serves as a torch in the dark to fellow subterranean miscreants standing in opposition to modernity. ‘<em>Surging Throng of Evil’s Might’</em> showcases ripping, riff-focused evil in the vein of early pan-American progenitors from the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, and Peru. Warp speed riffs and searing, chaotic solos played with uninhibited belligerence run headlong into horrific analog manipulation to guide the listener into total spiritual destruction in the outer realms. Quickly after self-releasing their initial offering, the band formed an alliance with 20 Buck Spin for an LP version of the demo as well as future conspiracies.</p>
<p>In mid-2019 a new shapeless evil will be unleashed. Wrought in the discordant shadows of the preternatural world, Superstition’s debut full length will bring humanity to waste in the pan-dimensional realms of illimitable darkness. Coinciding with the release will be a global assault upon the underground with performances across the US, Canada, Mexico, and Europe.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/29/announcement-20-first-ever-european-performance-of-druid-lord-us/index.html">Announcement #20: First ever European performance of DRUID LORD (us)!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Today marks the halfway point of the announcements. 20 up – 20 more to go go! We have made an overview of the bands that have been announced below in case you lost track. To mark this halfway point we have another special treat for you – a band that has never been over to this side of the pond before. We are excited to present, the Florida based doom/death outfit <strong>DRUID LORD</strong>&#8216;s first ever performance, as part of the the “Gloomy Sunday”!!!</p>
<p>Druid Lord was formed in the scorching wastelands of Orlando, Florida in 2010 by guitarist Pete Slate (Acheron, Equinox) , bassist/vocalist Tony Blakk (Acheron, Equinox, Diabolic) and original drummer Stephen Spillers (Equinox). All veterans of the FL early 90’s Death Metal scene they felt it was time to evoke something new and cryptic. From the beginning, the band&#8217;s intent was and still is to create crushing songs that take inspiration from early death metal (Possessed, Necrovore, Autopsy) and the heavy riffing of &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s doom bands like Cirith Ungol, Winter, and Celtic Frost. Druid Lord take considerable influence from old horror films and the classic movies of Lucio Fulci, Mario Bava, Dario Argento, and John Carpenter. It’s a journey that takes twists and turns within the music giving the listener a feeling of constant dread.</p>
<p>Druid Lord released their debut album, <em>“Hymns for the Wicked”,</em> in 2010 on Horror, Pain, Gore, Death productions. The album gained an impressive strong underground following in a short period of time.  Over the years a series of EP’s and split records were released including the haunting <em>“Druid Death Cult”</em> and <em>“Baron Blood”</em> EP’s for Doomentia Records. The band went through some various changes over the course of 2015 with current drummer Elden Santos joining the band and adding the perfect piece to their gloomy ensemble.</p>
<p>In 2018, Druid Lord released their 2nd full length album <em>&#8220;Grotesque Offerings”</em> with the support of Hells Headbangers, spreading their supernatural death and doom far and wide. The album recorded at Tony Blakk&#8217;s own Blakk Magik Studios and mixed/mastered by Mikko Saastamoinen (Hooded Menace) had been festering within the band for the last few years and has received high praises in the death/doom scene. Haunted castles, witchcraft, the occult, the living dead, dark folklore, and cryptic stories: no ancient stone is left unturned here.<br />
Summer of 2018 saw the addition of guitarist Chris Wicklein from the FL Death Metal band Killing Addiction replacing Ben Ross. A series of live shows followed and now  in 2019 Druid Lord continues to write new music for an upcoming EP as well as planning tours and festivals in support of <em>“Grotesque Offerings”.</em> Killtown Death fest will be very a special occasion for the band as it marks their first time on European soil.</p>

	<p>Turning our attention back now to Canada, we are pleased to welcome a band that has graced the European stage only once so far in their journey, and not yet on the mainland. More than three years since the release of their last album, it is certainly long overdue that we announce that <strong>ADVERSARIAL </strong>will join us at KTDF 2019!</p>
<p>Formed 12 years ago, it wasn’t long after their 2008 demo that Adversarial joined forces with Dark Descent Records before releasing their 2010 debut LP ‘All Idols Fall Before the Hammer’. With fire and destruction as their impetus, the album was a powerful blast to the face of those who cast their bleeding ears upon it. Rejecting social groups and status, Adversarial channels the knowledge attained through a distancing from man and society into a malevolent assault fuelled by a hatred for such futile concepts.</p>
<p>The band’s last album, 2015’s ‘Death, Endless Nothing and the Black Knife of Nihilism’, saw the band at their most fierce to date. Described by Cvlt Nation as “a tightly wound beast of destruction that is as dynamic as it is punishing”, Adversarial balances powerful aggression with songwriting prowess.</p>
<p>Be prepared and expect no mercy as Adversarial brings their Nihilist Warcult Death Metal to the stage at Kill-Town Deathfest 2019.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/27/announcement-18-drowned-de-returning-to-ktdf/index.html">Announcement #18: Drowned (de) returning to KTDF!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Today we have the distinct honour of presenting one of our favorite German death metal bands of all time. The band has been around for almost 27 years with various levels of activity, but still managed to put forth some of the best death metal to ever emerge from the German metal underground. Having recently added a 4<sup>th</sup> member to their line-up, their performance at this years KTDF will be a rare opportunity to catch them live and in this new constellation. We are very excited to announce that <strong>DROWNED</strong> will return to Kill-Town Death fest VII!!!</p>
<p>Drowned was founded in 1992 in Berlin and has since gone through a good number of demos, line-up changes, split-ups and long comatose intervals. Their last full length album Idola Specus fom 2014 contains material written over a period of roughly six years and introducing new members T 2 and G, it takes up the torch from where Drowned left off with their mini-album Viscera Terrae in 2006. Instead of presenting a rehash of times begone, Idola Specus proved to be a valid statement to the gospel of Death Metal as it was meant to be played. Emanating an aura of surreal morbidity with hints of doom and prog, Idola Specus is as esoteric and introspective as it is dark, heavy, and raw.</p>
<p>In support of the album, Drowned played a two-week European tour, as well as a string of club shows and festivals such as Hell’s Pleasure, Nidrosian Black Mass, Metal Mean, Til Dovre Faller, Incubate, Hellfest, Live Evil, etc.</p>
<p>Late 2017 saw the addition of H as a second guitar player, premiered on the occasion of Grave Miasma’s 10-year celebration in London, UK.</p>
<p>Since 2018, Drowned has entered a state of seclusion in order to work on new material for a future album. As the silence will only be broken by very few selected shows, Kill-Town Death Fest will be a rare occasion the see the band perform in 2019.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/26/announcement-17-profetus-debuting-the-sadness-of-time-passing-entirely-and-exclusively-at-ktdfs-gloomy-sunday/index.html">Announcement #17: PROFETUS debuting “The Sadness of Time Passing” entirely and exclusively at KTDF´s “Gloomy Sunday”!</a></h1>
	<p>Today go back up to the deep forests of Finland where some of the darkest, heaviest and most miserable music was ever conceived. What we are presenting for you today is a unique opportunity to witness something special and new, never performed before. We are extremely proud and honoured to announce that the heirs of Thergothon, Finnish Funeral Doom cultists <strong>PROFETUS</strong> will return to Denmark with their new album <em>“The Sadness of Time Passing”</em>, delivering it entirely and exclusively at KTDF´s “Gloomy Sunday”!</p>
<p>Feel the timelessness of grief and sink into one-hour metamorphosis of their bleak hymns, of the most visionary crafts of Funeral Doom to come.</p>
<p>Profetus is a Funeral Doom collective from Tampere, Finland. Originated in 2006, they have created their own craft, a fine blend of 90s Finnish Funeral Doom tradition and Death Metal aesthetics; music that is bleak and crushingly heavy, utterly beautiful, cinematic and meditating. Minimalistic compositions moving at a glacial pace invoke a haunting journey to a world of obscurity.</p>
<p>Profetus has released 4 albums this far, and played tours with like-minded bands as Bell Witch and Mournful Congregation and took part of festivals like Roadburn, Heavy days in Doomtown and Finnish Death Metal Maniacs Fest. In a live context the extreme spatial qualities of Funeral Doom offer a rare setting for personal subliminal excavations.</p>
<p>In it&#8217;s current line-up A. Mäkinen (guitar, vocals) is joined by M. Mäkelä (baritone guitar, vocals), M. Saarikoski (guitar) V. Kujansuu (drums) and M. Nieminen (organ, synth).</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/25/announcement-16-bastard-grave-swe/index.html">Announcement #16: Bastard Grave (swe)!</a></h1>
	<p>Today we are looking towards our sister nation to the East, Sweden, where they since day one have had a mayor role in the development of death metal. The band we are about to announce are following that great tradition and keeping it low-fi, raw, punk and oldschool. Its the first of our announcements for the outdoor stage in ByHaven, where those of you attended last year will know the great vibe of the afternoon shows. This band also played the KTDF warm up show on said stage last year, so now we would finally like to welcome <strong>BASTARD GRAVE</strong> to play Kill-Town Death Fest!<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Bastard Grave is an oldschool death metal band from southern Sweden that likes to keep it primitive and raw. There is no place for technicality and musical show-off here, only lobotomized and disgusting death metal.  Started by a bunch of demented minds in 2012, and after releasing their first demo they immediately caught the attention of Pulverised Records in Singapore, and a deal was signed. At the end of 2015 the debut album <em>&#8220;What lies beyond&#8221;</em> was unleashed. It&#8217;s an album firmly rooted in the oldschool death metal of their home country Sweden, with added filth, hooks and punk mentality. Touring soon followed which took them to large parts of europe, and they have since then done a slew of shows in support of the album.</p>
<p>With a new album in the works, ready for release in time for Kill-Town Death Fest, expect a shift in focus from the frantic speed and riffing of the first album, into slower and murkier territories.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/24/announcement-15-of-feather-and-bone-us/index.html">Announcement #15: OF FEATHER AND BONE (us)!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Tonight we we look back towards North America and this to time to mountainous state of Colorado, where a pack of great bands have sprung from the last couple of years. The band we are about to announce is a band who released their sophomore album last year through Profound Lore Records and immediately caught our attention despite being around since 2014. The band have been busy touring the US and will continue to do so this year with bands like Horrendous, Skeletal Remains and Outre Tombe and in Europe after the festival with Tom Mold and Ritual Necromancy. We are excited to welcome <strong>OF FEATHER AND BONE</strong> to the KTDF VII line-up!!!</p>
<p>Emerging from their Rocky Mountain crypts, Of Feather and Bone spread their virulent strain of cryptic death metal on <em>&#8220;Bestial Hymns of Perversion&#8221;,</em> released March 9, 2018 on Profound Lore Records. Bassist/vocalist AS and Guitarist/vocalist DG herald the endtimes with a dual guttural onslaught atop an everflowing stream of grime-caked riffs and PW’s whirlwind of blasts and d-beats. Invoking the claustrophobia of Autopsy and the visceral disgust of Incantation and Bolt Thrower, Of Feather and Bone’s relentless death assault serves as the soundtrack to mankind’s fall.</p>
<p>After garnering substantial praise for their long sold-out 2016 demo, Of Feather and Bone returned to Goldberg Studios during the summer of 2017 with Steve Goldberg (Cephalic Carnage) at the helm. Mastered by the mighty Dan Lowndes at Resonance Sound and featuring stunning cover art courtesy of Stefan Todorovic, Bestial Hymns of Perversion’s seven tracks of unrelenting death metal portend the the destruction of the modern age.</p>
<p>Of Feather and Bone will enter the studio early spring 2019 to record the follow up to <em>&#8220;Bestial Hymns of Perversion&#8221;. </em></p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/23/announcement-14-one-off-exclusive-first-ever-european-performance-and-reunion-of-the-legendary-transgressor-jp/index.html">Announcement #14: one-off exclusive first ever European performance and reunion of the legendary TRANSGRESSOR (jp)!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Tonight we have a nice, rare and obscure treat for you! As many of you possibly know, Anatomia from Japan, is one of our favorite bands ever, where a strong bond has grown over the years. Takashi has been visiting and playing two times earlier with Anatomia and last year with Wormridden. Now we thought it would be interesting to go back to where it all began and present to you one of his earliest, formative bands from the late 80´ies Tokyo underground death metal scene. We are extremely proud and excited to present to you a one-off exclusive first ever European performance and reunion of the legendary <strong>TRANSGRESSOR!!!</strong></p>
<p>Transgressor was formed by Takashi (Drums/Vocals)(Anatomia/Necrophile/Wormridden) and Junichi (Guitars/Bass) after their former thrash band Gamvetta broke up in 1989. They released their first demo <em>“Transmigration”</em> in the same year which led them to finding of the bassist Akihito (ex-Jurassic Jade) to complete the line-up.</p>
<p>Transgressor started actively to play local gigs and released the second demo <em>“Twisting Brochus”</em> in 1990. Having the demo professionally recorded with some improvements made, the response was satisfactory and promoted greatly to the overseas underground scene.</p>
<p>In 1991, Junichi left the band but soon Kimihide (ex-Meltdown/Quench) joined in for the replacement. Three songs were recorded with Yoshio (ex-Necro-E/ex-Anatomia) joining in as the second guitarist and the first full-length album <em>“Ether for Scapegoat” </em>was released by Dutch label Cyber Music in 1992. Their music slightly changed into a slower death/doom with dark atmospheres.</p>
<p>In 1992, the band broke up again mainly due to Takashi moving to the US for a couple of years. After Takashi returned to Japan in 1996, they reformed by recruiting new members but it only lasted until they recorded few songs for compilation releases.</p>
<p>Although they have played once outside Japan, in Detroit in 1994, the show at Kill-Town Death Fest will be their first time ever in Europe and the first since their reunion show in Tokyo in 2015.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/22/announcement-13-ritual-necromancy-us-returns-to-ktdf-vii/index.html">Announcement #13: Ritual Necromancy (us) returns to KTDF VII!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Tonight we welcome back one of Portland’s finest, who last played Kill-Town back in 2014 for the “Funeral Edition”. Last year in 2018, they released via Dark Descent Records, one of our favourite albums of the year. So its with great pleasure we can announce that <strong>RITUAL NECROMANCY </strong>will play Kill-Town Death Fest VII!!!</p>
<p>Uncompromising, suffocating, and evil &#8211; Ritual Necromancy’s approach to death metal is that of predator to prey, sinking its teeth into the listener with violent intent.</p>
<p>Spawned in 2008, Ritual Necromancy haunted Portland, Oregon’s local death metal scene and recorded a self-titled demo. A pact with Dark Descent Records was forged and in 2011, <em>“Oath of the Abyss”,</em> the first offering to the grave, was unleashed. That same year, Ritual Necromancy joined forces with Impetuous Ritual, Grave Upheaval, and Cruciamentum for a maniacal West Coast tour to the infamous Rites of Darkness III Fest, where the band twisted some heads and turned many stomachs.</p>
<p>2014 saw the release of a 3-song EP entitled “Void Manifest,” which conjured a short tour with Bölzer, culminating in the slaughter of Vancouver’s Covenant Festival. That year, Ritual Necromancy also invaded Europe for the first time, unleashing their punishment upon the hordes of Kill-Town Death Fest´s Funeral Edition, then continued the carnage across Europe with Canadian titans Mitochondrion and Auroch.</p>
<p><em>“Disinterred Horror”</em>, the long-anticipated second full-length album, finally rises from the grave in 2018 to much fetid acclaim. Relentless and bludgeoning, <em>“Disinterred Horror”</em> strangles you with unseen hands, tormenting your soul long after it’s over. Like a nightmare you can’t shake, the malevolence of this album settles in your brain, landing it on many “Best of the year” lists. Also in 2018, Ritual Necromancy savaged audiences at Invoking Black Death and Maryland Deathfest with morbid ferocity.</p>
<p>As 2019 emanates from the pit, no continent or grave is safe from these practitioners of Death’s Metal, as a short attack on Mexico and later dates in Europe have been conjured.</p>
<p>Now Ritual Necromancy returns the chaos to KTDF as they drag you deep into the hell of necrotic torment.</p>
<p>Possessed Death Metal by fiends who worship the Freezing Void, Ritual Necromancy is not for the weak.</p>

	<h1><a href="../../../../2019/01/21/announcement-12-malthusian-irl/index.html">Announcement #12: Malthusian (irl)!!!</a></h1>
	<p>Tonight we go back to Europe, or at least a faraway corner out in the ocean, to find the next act we are presenting. We are turning our eye towards Dublin, Ireland where a man and his label for the past two decades has been spewing out good releases through Invictus Productions. The band we are about to announce are on said label and and put out their debut LP last year spewing forth some of the most malignant and haunting death metal to emerge from Ireland since… ever? We are proud to present that the pretty Dublin boys of <strong>MALTHUSIAN </strong>will grace us with a visit!!!</p>
<p>Manifested in the bowels of Dublin city in 2013, Malthusian have made their presence in the world more known with each festering, ill-conceived release. The well received release of both their demo MMXIII and subsequent EP, <em>“Below The Hengiform”,</em> saw the band on a UK run and two European tours in 2015, as well as a number of dates on the East coast of the US following an appearance at the now defunct Martyrdoom festival in New York. 2016 saw the band play a slew of festivals and one of shows including appearances at Oration Fest in Iceland and Beyond The Gates in Norway.</p>
<p>Back on the terra firma of Èire, with a vision to solidify the abstract horrors of black, death and doom in their own unique way, 2017 saw the band write their debut album <em>“Across Deaths” </em>and record in the fitting surroundings of Hellfire Studios in Dublin. An ugly, malignant demonstration of the band&#8217;s power to create dark, oppressive music, as only they know how. Elaborating on previously explored elements and honing their wretched skill to create unease, with <em>“Across Deaths”,</em> Malthusian have created a decaying monument to the unhinged minds, and music therein, of the band&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>2019 will see <strong>MALTHUSIAN</strong> spew forth with more focus and filth than ever before. The future is bleak!!!</p>
